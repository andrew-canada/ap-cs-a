- https://github.com/dlbunker/ps-collections-1z0-819

## must know
### collections
- what is collection
- lists, sets, queues, maps
- java collection api hierarchy and attributes

### arrays
- declaring single and multidemensional arrays
- iterating, sorting, and searching arrays
- arrays
- array comparisons with equals, compare, and mismatch methods

### lists

## collections
- group of items with some way of accessing them
- indexed by number, position, or key
- must store OBJECTS, not primitives; primitives can use wrapper classes

###types
- lists
	- position by number
	- arraylist, linkedlist
- sets
	- position by number
	- unique
	- hashset, treeset
- queues
	- position by entry
	- priorityqueue
- maps
	- performance doesn't change as size grows
	- doesn't extend from collection
	- hashmap, treemap
